# outsider

Outsider is currently a wordpress plugin created to manage triahtletes, runners, swimmers and ciclists. 

It was developed using traditional LAMP technologies: Apache web server, MySQL, PHP and Knockout.js (for the frontend). 

The aim of this project is to migrate it to a MEAN stack: MongoDb and moongose, node.js (Express), Angular 2, Hogan and Sass. The javascript version that will be used in the backend part of the application is ES6, in the frontpart ES5 will be the choice.

In order to develop in a more functional style, lodash will be included in the project too.

I will develop using TDD style (BDD) both in the backend (Mocha+chai) and in the frontend (Cucumber+Selenium js).

The continous integration tool for the project will be Jenkins (will run in a local machine).

The structure of the project has been made using express-generator (a express scaffolding node package).
