# outsider

Outsider is currently a wordpress plugin created to manage triahtletes, runners, swimmers and ciclists. It was developed using traditional LAMP technologies: Apache web server, MySQL, PHP and Knockout.js (for the frontend). The aim of this project is to migrate it to a MEAN stack: MongoDb and moongose, node.js (Express), Angular 2, Hogan and Sass. It'll be used Ecmascript 6 in the backend part of the application. The idea is to develop using TDD style both in the backend (Mocha+chai) as well as in the frontend (Cucumber+Selenium js).

The structure of the project has been made using express-generator (a express scaffolding node package).
